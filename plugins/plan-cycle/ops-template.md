# Operations Guide

Operations available on the accompanying plan. Any coding agent can follow these instructions.

## Operation Dispatch Rule

Identify the requested operation by the user's **exact** wording:

- `plan-cycle-annotate` → run section `## plan-cycle-annotate`.
- `plan-cycle-review` → run section `## plan-cycle-review`.
- `plan-cycle-finalize` → run section `## plan-cycle-finalize`.

**No aliases.** If wording doesn't exactly match one of the three, do NOT execute: reply

> Operazione non riconosciuta. Le operazioni valide su questo piano sono: `plan-cycle-annotate`, `plan-cycle-review`, `plan-cycle-finalize`.

Existing `> **NOTE**:` lines don't change the requested operation. For `plan-cycle-annotate`, never edit/remove/resolve/rewrite existing plan content.

## plan-cycle-annotate

Add inline annotations below the section/task they refer to. Do NOT modify plan content — only add notes.

**Format:** `> **NOTE**: [tag?] comment`. Tags: `[impact]` (plan-impact skill), `[quality: <criterion>]` (plan-quality skill), none (user). `plan-cycle-review` processes all uniformly.

**Safety check:** before editing, state "plan-cycle-annotate mode: I will only add `> **NOTE**:` lines." After editing, verify the diff only adds notes + blank spacing; if it removes/modifies non-note text, revert and redo.

## plan-cycle-review

1. Read the entire plan.
2. Find all `> **NOTE**:` lines.
3. For each: understand, update plan, remove annotation.
4. If unclear, keep it and ask for clarification.

## plan-cycle-finalize

Make the plan operative, self-contained, coherent, robust — a fresh agent must execute it without prior context.

1. Read the entire plan.
2. For each section, check ALL 11 rules: Self-contained, Operative, Outcome-layer success, Numbers-not-adjectives, Exit clauses, Explicit degradation, Verify-before-claim, Enumerate-universals, Mark-unverifiable, Coherent, Robust.
3. Rewrite every failing section — do not annotate.
4. Report: sections updated count + one-line summary per section.
5. **Unresolved Items Inventory** — list every remaining TODO, `assumed:`, `unverified:`. For each, prompt the user per item: *resolve before execution* or *proceed knowingly with consequence stated*. Approval is invalid without this step.

## General Principles

- `plan-cycle-annotate` may only add `> **NOTE**:` annotations — never rewrites.
- `plan-cycle-review` and `plan-cycle-finalize` rewrite plan content directly.
- Multiple annotate passes can run before a single review pass.
- The plan is approved only when the owner explicitly says so.
